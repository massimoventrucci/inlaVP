This package contains functions to fit Variance Partiotioning (VP) disease mapping models in R-INLA; these models are described in the paper by 
Franco-Villoria M et al. (2021), where a new approach to model space-time interactions is presented. One relevant application concerns spatio-temporal disease mapping. 
But, in general, the proposed models may be adopted in all those applications where intrinsic GMRFs are meant as tools to perform smoothing in more than one dimension; 
for instance in the analysis of grid-data such as those arising from agricultural field trials or spatio-temporal data from environmental studies and ecological surveys.

The long-term plan is to produce some extra material on how to use the package, wignettes etc. 

In case you find the package useful and you want to use it and refer to it, please quote:

If you have any issue about the package (or any ideas on how to improve the material in there) please send an email to massimo.ventrucci@unibo.it.
